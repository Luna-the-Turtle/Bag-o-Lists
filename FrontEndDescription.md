# Bag o' Lists – *Track, Share, and Sync Custom Lists in Foundry VTT*

**Bag o' Lists** is a versatile module for Foundry VTT that lets GMs and players create, share, and manage multiple customizable lists—perfect for tracking factions, resources, crafting materials, ammunition, and more. With real-time updates powered by socketlib, every change is instantly synced across all users.

---

## Features
- **Create and manage multiple “bags” (tabs)** for any purpose—factions, resources, NPCs, and more.
- **Add custom images** to items for visual flair.
- **GM and player views:** GMs see and control all data, players see only their relevant lists.
- **Items can disappear at zero or persist,** based on GM settings.
- **Player-controlled items:** let players adjust values directly.
- **Real-time updates** for all users using socketlib.
