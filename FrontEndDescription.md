# Bag o' Lists – *Track, Share, and Sync Custom Lists in Foundry VTT*

**Bag o' Lists** is a versatile module for Foundry VTT that lets GMs and players create, share, and manage multiple customizable lists—perfect for tracking factions, resources, crafting materials, ammunition, and more. With real-time updates powered by socketlib, every change is instantly synced across all users.

## Features
- **Create and manage multiple “bags” (tabs)** for any purpose—factions, resources, NPCs, and more.
- **Add custom images** to items for visual flair.
- **GM and player views:** GMs see and control all data, players see only their relevant lists.
- **Items can disappear at zero or persist,** based on GM settings.
- **Player-controlled items:** let players adjust values directly.
- **Real-time updates** for all users using socketlib.

# Bag o' Lists v1.0 is Now Available on Foundry VTT

After weeks of development, I'm excited to announce that the Bag o' Lists module is officially approved and ready for download!

# What is Bag o' Lists?

A versatile list management module designed to streamline your Foundry VTT experience. Whether you're tracking NPCs, managing loot, reputation, or any numeric, meter, or list in general, this tool is built to be your go-to solution.

# Key Features

* **Easy Installation** – Available directly through Foundry's module browser. (It is listed on Foundry, I made it!)
* **Intuitive Interface** – Clean, user-friendly design. It was kept simple and straightforward for use.
* **Versatile Application** – Completely agnostic so it will work for any system.
* **Lightweight** – Won't slow down your game. In my testing it didn't slow down game at all, but I didn't test the limits.

# My Development Journey

This project turned into a much bigger learning experience than I ever imagined! From setting up proper **attribution** to building a **front-end interface** in Foundry, **packaging everything correctly** for manifest installs, and navigating the **approval process**.

There were countless details I hadn't considered, and everything took *way* more time than expected. But I'm proud of the final result!

I believe it's versatile enough to become a **staple for anyone running games in Foundry**. I'm hoping to see it one day make the lists like "Top Foundry Modules My Game Can't Live Without". I am also hoping to see how the community uses it and what creative applications you come up with.

# Ways To Use Bag o' Lists

* Tracking reputation for factions
* Tracking reputation for NPCs
* Tracking ammunition or consumables (player-tracked, can persist at zero)
* Recording accomplishments for Adventurer’s League or Pathfinder Society (e.g., Treasure Bundles, Goals)
* Managing crafting materials and ingredients
* Monitoring quest progress or objectives for individual players or the party
* Keeping a list of loot, inventory, or shared party resources
* Tracking spell slots, charges, or magical item uses
* Organizing NPC relationships or contacts
* Managing downtime activities or tasks
* Tracking player votes or group decisions
* Monitoring resource pools (e.g., group funds, rations, torches)
* Keeping a list of scene-specific details (e.g., clues, discovered locations)
* Tracking initiative order or turn-based effects
